How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?
-1week refining and 1,5 completing it.

Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.
-I choose the functional programming route since i am not a "true backend developer" and found sucess with it.Of course would do OOP ,given it is more superior to tackle certain assignments.
-Choose node.js for my backend work since i am a educated front-end dev at heart with full-stack ambitions and node is perfect for me as it is like js but backend.
-No frameworks to work on the fundamentals of html,css,js and node which have a great carry over to using frameworks like (React,Bootstrap) in future works/.


What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding 
test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
-Better erorr managment on the backend and a bit on front end.
-Inplementing my own node.js webserver to host the client instead of using live-server depedency browser.
-Offline mode since the infrastructure is there,with the localstorage and updating of apidata. 

What did you think of this recruitment test?
-I enjoyed it,hopefully it turned out well :).Refined this code based on comments i got from other companies/teachers more knowledgable than me.
