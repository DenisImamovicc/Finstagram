Photo gallery(Client) and REST API(Server).

## Installation
Create a terminal,then acess the server to download necessary node files and dependecies
```bash
cd Server
npm install
```
## Activating Api
Type in the terminal while in the Server directory...
```bash
npm start
```
Starts the api on localhost:5000.If you want to shut down then...
```bash
ctrl+c
```
```bash
npm start
```
## Activating Gallery
Go to hosted live version page in the github about section or this link:
```
https://denisimamovicc.github.io/Finstagram/Client
```
If you want to try in your desktop instead then type in the terminal while in the Client directory...
```bash
live-server
```
Starts the gallery page on a localhost in your browser.

If you want to see how gallery reacts without Api,to simulate server issues, then call only the "live server"command or if on hosted version disable the api.
