Photo gallery and REST API.

## Installation
Create a terminal,then...
```bash
npm install
```
## Activating Api
Type in the terminal...
```bash
npm start
```
Starts the api on localhost:5000.
## Activating gallery
Create another terminal and then type...
```bash

If you want to see how gallery reacts without Api,to simulate server issues, then call only the "live server"command.Load the page for good measure.
