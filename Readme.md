Photo gallery(Client) and REST API(Server).

## Installation
Create a terminal,then acess the client or the server by...
```bash

```
or
```bash
cd Server
npm install
```
## Activating Api
Type in the terminal while in the Server directory...
```bash
npm start
```
Starts the api on localhost:5000.
## Activating Gallery
Type in the terminal while in the Client directory...
```bash

If you want to see how gallery reacts without Api,to simulate server issues, then call only the "live server"command.Load the page for good measure.
